This week was the last week of our two week group project sprint. We had to design and implement a project from scratch. We worked on coming up with the idea, deciding on a design, figuring out the page flow and the coding. It was a really great experience. I loved the fact that my group clicked really early on in the process. We were able to quickly and easy to make decisions. This, of course, led to us being more productive with our time. 

One of the biggest things I learned was the value of git and GitHub. Branches are a definite necessity when working on projects. Along with communicating well at all times, branches help eleviate merge conflicts and prevent mistakes when pushing. The other thing that stuck out was the fact that it's important to be able to laugh at mistakes. Maybe it was the ability to stay humble and not getting overly confident. I have learned so much in the few weeks of the bootcamp. I still have a lot to learn. The knowledge that I have is just enough to give me the confidence of knowing that I can solve problems I come across as I code. If I can't solve it on my own, I know that I have resources available to me to help - other developers.
