I started my journey for learning to code at Rockit Bootcamp in Phoenix, AZ. Since then, I've taken various courses at CodeSchool, CodeAcademy, and others. I am truly enjoying the challenge of coding.

Previously, I was a 4th and 5th grade teacher and, before that, a cosmetologist. While teaching, I incroporated various technologies into the lessons I created. I started a computer coding club using Scratch from MIT and supervised a FIRST Lego Robotics league.
